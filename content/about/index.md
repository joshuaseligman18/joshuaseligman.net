## Background
Born and raised in New Jersey, I wrote my first lines of code in middle
school and have not looked back since. While I hold an interest in back-end
systems development, a lot of my professional and project experiences have
provided me with knowledge in full-stack web development and continuous
integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Over time, I have truly
fallen in love with using TypeScript/JavaScript and Rust
(you can call me a Rustacean :crab:).

## Education
I am a graduate student at Marist College :fox: working towards my 
Master's degree in Software Development. I am also a Marist alum,
having earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science there.
Throughout my time at school, I have remained an active member of the
community by being heavily involved and taking leadership in clubs, such
as the Marist College Computer Society. I even worked in
the Admissions Office as a tour guide for a few years!

## Hobbies
First and foremost, I am a die-hard New York Yankees :baseball: and New York
Rangers :hockey: fan. I also really enjoy watching movies, especially
science fiction films and anything directed by Christopher Nolan :clapper_board:.
Lastly, I have recently started reading a lot, which you can learn more about
my journey [here]({{< ref "blog/books" >}}).
