## Background
Born and raised in New Jersey, I wrote my first lines of code in middle
school and have not looked back since. While I hold an interest in back-end
systems development, a lot of my professional and project experiences have
provided me with knowledge in full-stack web development and continuous
integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Over time, I have truly
fallen in love with using TypeScript/JavaScript and Rust (you can call me a
Rustacean :crab:). I am also working on learning an up-and-coming language
called Zig :high_voltage:!

## Education
I am a double alumn from Marist College :fox:, having earned both my Bachelor's
and Master's degrees in Computer Science and Software Development, respectfully.
While a student, I was an active member of the community by being heavily
involved and taking leadership in clubs, such as the Marist College Computer
Society. I even worked in the Admissions Office as a tour guide for a few years!

## Hobbies
First and foremost, I am a die-hard New York Yankees :baseball: and New York
Rangers :hockey: fan. I also really enjoy watching movies, especially
science fiction films and anything directed by Christopher Nolan :clapper_board:.
Lastly, I have recently started reading a lot, which you can learn more about
my journey [here]({{< ref "blog/books" >}}).
